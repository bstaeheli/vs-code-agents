## Value Statement Under Test

"As a user of the agent framework, I want all manual handoff UI elements removed from agents and the Planner updated to act as a true orchestrator that delegates work to subagents when asked to 'execute until completion,' so that I no longer need to manually switch between agents and the workflow runs end-to-end when I grant permission."
